Each pair sits on the floor in the centre of the space facing each other, with their back against the long sides of this space (see the attachments for a drawing of the space and the correct positioning) with their shoes off. With your eyes closed listen attentively to the sounds filling the space and take control of your breath. Now imagine being in complete solitude with your partner, really focus on their features (eyes, nose, fingers, body-language) and the rhythm of their breathing. Try to really feel connected to him/her.&nbsp;</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>&nbsp;Now take each other’s hands.

Capture what you feel and memorize this feeling.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Now position yourself horizontally on the floor with your eyes facing the ceiling or sky, your body is again following the longest side of the room. Your legs should be separated from each other and touching/pushing against the feet of your partner. Together you will be forming a pane (dutch: een ruit)&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Last, stand up straight now facing the wall with your eyes closed completely distanced from your partner, keep in mind to focus on your breathing. What are you thinking about?&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;When you are ready open your eyes and turn 180°, facing your partner pressed to their body completely. Wait until your partner is ready to face you.</div><div>&nbsp;Stay in this position pressed against each other. What are you thinking about?&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Are you comfortable?

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">STUDIOMOSE &nbsp;was founded in September 2017. It is an Antwerp based sustainable art and styling studio recontextualizing finely selected secondhand clothing and thereby not supporting the polluting fast fashion industry. We support ethical, handmade, and thrifted fashion. By thrifting clothes you are not voting for the fastfashion industry (Zara, H&amp;M, Berschka...) and thereby not supporting cruelty. Cruelty towards our planet (massive pollution). You are also not supporting bad working conditions and child labour. Know what you vote for with your money, because by buying at those shops means supporting them and all the horrible things they don't want you to know. Together we can make a change, thrift and still look damn good! I know it's amazing how cheap these shops are, especially for those who don't have a big budget and want to look trendy. But clearly someone is paying for it: the people/children who work for these corporate companies. Just think about who you want to support with your money. This doesn't mean you have to shop at expensive brands, this means you have to do your research about these fast fashion companies, what they do and what kind of working conditions you are supporting. Also, just shop less and be more creative: swap with friends, go thrifting or adjust your clothes and maybe buy a book or CD instead, if you really have the urge to satisfy your shopaholic needs. I truly care and that doesn't mean that you have to care as well, I just hope to inspire people who also care more about lives than looks.&nbsp;<br>Every month I put our newest secondhand and vintage finds online in an editorial format. The pictures, casting, styling and creative direction are done by me. Working with other young artistic talents is an aspiration, in that way STUDIOMOSE can grow into a collaborative studio. You can find us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/studiomose/">Instagram</a>&nbsp;to place a bid on your favorite pieces, bidding can be done for 24h. The highest bid receives an invoice and pays within the hour. Have fun!</h3>
